Assignment for CS66: Intro to Computer Science II

For this assignment, we were given the card.java file and were given instructions to fill the deck.java and war.java files with code to allow for the user to play the card game War using the console. To run this code, install all three .java files and place them in the directory of your preferred IDE. Run the war.java class and enjoy the game!
